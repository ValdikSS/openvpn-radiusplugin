-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The plugin was developed during my diploma thesis for the EWETEL GmbH (www.ewetel.net). 
They main idea was to create a virtualized SSL-VPN with RADIUS support. 
The virtualization was done by XEN. 
At this place I would like to thank the people from EWETEL GmbH and EWE AG (www.ewe.de) 
who supported me with the required equipment, hardware 
and helped me with all my questions.

The plugin was developed and tested under Debian Sarge and OpenVPN 2.0 on x86-machines. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The RADIUS-Class:
-----------------
For this plugin was developed a RADIUS-Class in C++. It was based on the C-library FF RADIUS Library v0.1 from
Fabrizio Fiorucci (http://ffradiuslib.ff.homelinux.net).
If somebody is interested in a standalone RADIUS-class please contact me. There will be some little changes.


DOCUMENTATION:
--------------
The documentation is done with doxygen. 
To generate the documentation execute "doxygen doxygen.conf" in the folder of the plugin.


INSTALL:
--------
1. Requirements: the libgcrypt library.

2. Compile: see section COMPILE

3. Set the plugin in the OpenVPN configfile: plugin /path/to/plugin/radiusplugin.so [configfile]

4. Create a configfile for the plugin, see radiusplugin.cnf. If no path is set in the configfile of OpenVPN
	the plugin will read the file /etc/openvpn/radiusplugin.cnf: .
   The configuration is case-sensitive, for an example see radiusplugin.cnf.

5. Set some configuration in the config file of the OpenVPN server:
	- status /var/log/openvpn/status.log 1  # The status, where the plugin reads the accounting information from.

6. Configure in the config file of the OpenVPN client:
	- auth-user-pass [/etc/openvpn/passwd]  # Set this for sending a username and password to the server, this values are the username and password for the radius authentication.

7. If you use auth_control_file (>= OpenVPN 2.1 rc8), the plugin directory needs write permission to the OpenVPN directory or use the "--tmp-dir" option to define a directory for the files.

8. Maybe write your own script for vendor specific attributes (see section VENDOR SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES).

FREERADIUS EXAMPLE
-------------------
user1  Cleartext-Password := "testing"
       Service-Type = Framed-User,
       Framed-IP-Netmask = 255.255.255.0,
       Framed-IP-Address = 10.8.0.33,
       Framed-Routing = Broadcast-Listen,
       Framed-Compression = Van-Jacobsen-TCP-IP,
       Framed-Route += "192.168.101.0/26 10.8.0.1/32 1",
       Framed-Route += "192.168.111.0/24 10.8.0.1/32 1",
       Framed-Route += "192.168.112.0/24 10.8.0.1/32 1",
       Acct-Interim-Interval=5,
       Ascend-Data-Rate=100,
       Ascend-Xmit-Rate=200,
       Framed-Protocol = PPP

The Framed-Route attribute must be in the format as shown above!

client-disconnect               ACCOUNTING REQUEST (Stop)		


RADIUS ATTRIBUTES WHICH PARSED BY THE PLUGIN AND WRITE TO THE CLIENT CONFIG FILE:
---------------------------------------------
- Framed ip address
- Acct Interim Interval
- Framed Routes (only in following format, e.g.: "192.168.101.0/26 10.8.0.1/32 1")


OTHER RADIUS ATTRIBUTES
-----------------------
- Reply Message 	the text is forwarded to stderr

VENDOR SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES
---------------------------
If you want use vendor specific attributes the plugin can call your own program or script at the OpenVPN action
CLIENT-CONNECT and CLIENT-DISCONNECT.
If you want to use the feature you have to specify the program and a named pipe for communication
in the config file.
The file vsascript.pl shows an example.


LIMITS:
-------
commonname of the certificate 256 characters 
routes entry from the radius server 50 characters


LIMITS in RadiusConfig for the configfile:
------------------------------------------
(The limit is the length of the array minus 1!)
char serviceType[2]; 			
char framedProtocol[2]; 		
char nasPortType[2]; 			
char nasIdentifier[128]; 		
char nasIpAddress[16]; 			
char p2p[16];
char subnet[16];



TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
- BSD:
	- RADIUS attributes FramedIP and FramedRoutes mandatory
	- RADIUS attribute FramedIP is ignored
	- Use gmake -f Makefile.bsd (maybe you have to adapt library and include path, it was tested for FreeBSD)

- Setting of Framed-Routes fails under BSD:
	- At the moment the plugin can only set the routes on Linux OSs.
	- The system call for "route ... " must be changed. Please contact me for a patch.
	- Newer version will integrate OS dependent calls. 

- OpenVPN hangs when a client connects:
	- Check OpenVPN config and check the OpenVPN log (debuglevel 7): 
		- The plugin needs following varibales from OpenVPN in ENVP-array:
			- username, password, untrusted_ip, common_name, untrusted_port, ifconfig_pool_remote_ip, verb
			- In some cases ifconfig_pool_remote_ip is missing (Depends on OpenVPN config).

- The radius packets are sent over the wrong interface:
	- Sometimes on multi interface machines with IPSec the operating system doesn't find the right interface.
	- Use the plugin from Magne J. Andreassen (it is for version 1.2a)

- The plugin writes client config files without any entry:
	- The plugin always writes the file for every connecting client, please set the ccd path 
		in the config file of the plugin to a existing dummy directory.
		
- Compiling fails on Solaris 10:
	- add following options: -lsocket -lnsl -lresolv
	
- Values for BytesIn/BytesOut are 0 in the accounting log of the RADIUS server:
	- Make sure that the status file of OpenVPN exists and the plugin can read it.
	- Use version 1 for the status file.

- Error at compiling: not initialised shared memory before the call to the MD5 function:
	- Make sure that you use libgrypt 1.2.0 or higher.

- Error at compiling: DBG: md_enable: algorithm -4195948 not available:
	- Make sure that you use libgrypt 1.2.0 or higher.

- The plugin can't write the auth_control_file.
        - The plugin needs write permission in the OpenVPN directory.



FOR TESTING
-----------

Attention: Some values are hard coded in main.cpp testing, so you can get unexpected values when testing.
For example the framedip is always 10.8.0.100, because it is read from the environment variable "ifconfig_pool_remote_ip", which is passed 
to the plugin from OpenVPN!
All hard coded variabled:
env1[0]="username=user1";
env1[1]="password=testing";
env1[2]="verb=10";
env1[3]="untrusted_ip=127.0.0.1";
env1[4]="common_name=R-VPNGateway1";
env1[5]="trusted_ip=127.0.0.1";
env1[6]="ifconfig_pool_remote_ip=10.8.0.100";

compile for test with a main function:
g++ -Wall -o main AccountingProcess.cpp Exception.cpp PluginContext.cpp UserAuth.cpp AcctScheduler.cpp IpcSocket.cpp radiusplugin.cpp User.cpp AuthenticationProcess.cpp main.cpp UserAcct.cpp UserPlugin.cpp Config.cpp RadiusClass/RadiusAttribute.cpp RadiusClass/RadiusPacket.cpp RadiusClass/RadiusConfig.cpp RadiusClass/RadiusServer.cpp  RadiusClass/RadiusVendorSpecificAttribute.cpp -lgcrypt
